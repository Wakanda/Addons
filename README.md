Addons
======

The Addons extension is already in Wakanda 9. This version is for users who want to try the latest stable features available. 

Here is what is different from the pre-installed version of the Addons :

1. Download of multiple widgets at once : if you add the attribute externalWidgets in your package, these widgets will also be installed. Example : Widget Tabs (install this widget via Addons and list of required widgets will be also installed)
 

2. Possibility to install widgets directly by their github url, for example https://github.com/rmello4d/BarCode/tree/WAK10


3. Support versioning between wakanda version (WAK9 , WAK10 and main)

4. Ability of sorting widgets by a lot of criteria : Date , already installed , up to update , owner ...
