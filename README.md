Addons
======

The Addons extension is already in Wakanda. This version is for users who want to try the latest stable features available. 

Here is what is different from the pre-installed version of the Addons :

1. Download of multiple widgets at once : if you add the attribute externalWidgets in your package, these widgets will also be installed; See the effect of this feature by downloading the WakendoButton widget (the WakendoCore will be also installed). 
2. Possibility to install widgets directly by their github url, for example https://github.com/rmello4d/BarCode/tree/WAK10
